Oh is a Unix shell written in Go.  Like the rc shell, oh is similar in spirit
but different in detail from other Unix shells.

The following commands behave as expected:

date
cat /usr/share/dict/words
who >user.names
who >>user.names
wc <file
echo [a-f]*.c
who | wc
who; date
cc *.c &
mkdir junk && cd junk
cd ..
rm -r junk || echo "rm failed!"

Oh adds support for concurrent, object-based and higher-order programming. See
using.oh and the sample scripts in the examples directory for more details.

To compile and run oh you will need go-tecla:

   github.com/michaelmacinnis/go-tecla

Oh is released under an MIT-style license.
